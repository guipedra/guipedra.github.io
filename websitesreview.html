<h1>Websites Review</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.google.com">Google (But not Google itself, the Google page after you look up something in the "search" box)</a></h2>

<p> What I like about looking up something on Google is that everyting is very neat and organized. If for eexample, you look up "Brazil" on that search box, on the left side of the page, it shows the most common/accurate results of what you're looking up, for example the Wikipedia, the Britannica pages for it, and other websites that have the information about the country. There is also a section with "People also ask" with dropdown boxes about the most common questions about the country on Google, I think that is a cool and valuable feature to have. I also how like there is a "box" to the right of the page that compresses the country's main information, such as a quick summary, capital, population, currency, etc. But most importantly, the left and the right sides have enough space to show the information it needs to be shown without overlapping each other, but still being an easy read and understandable. Another feature I like is right below the new and shorter search box on the page, the "News", "Maps","Images", "Videos", and "More" boxes/hyperlinks, that could direct you to those type of informations in a new link. </p>

<p> Overall, I think those result pages are very easy to navigate through, with extremely handful content that always seems to help finding whatever you looked up, just plain colors, but that's not necesarily a bad thing, as simplicity is one of the factors that really helps the navigation on Google. It has good, understandable, and decent sized fonts. All those components and the "functions" I mentioned on the previous paragrapgh, make up for one sensational website.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.sitebuilder.com">Sitebuilder</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sitebuilder provides a website builder based on questions you answer in an interview right when you join the service</li>
  <li>Simple interface that allows you to edit your page to what youn want while also keeping it professional</li>
  <li>Lets you to check engagement stats and visitor metrics in real-time</li>
  <li>Offers domains such as .com, .net, .org, .info, .eu, .us, etc.</li>
  <li>Varies from $7.18-11.18/mo depending on what plan you choose</li>
</ul>
<p> Although Sitebuilder offers good services and features and it's easy to work with, I wouldn't get their webhosting service, mainly for how much more expensive it is monthly compared to other providers, which total up to a huge difference at the end of the year compared to the other hosts in this review</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Employee-owned: focuses on the unique needs of the users, "committed to helping everyone find success online"</li>
  <li>They have many security features and services</li>
  <li>Provides a strong "anti-spam" policy that assists with privacy</li>
  <li>Guarantees a fast and reliable uptime</li>
  <li>Offers domains such as .club, .io, .online, .com, .shop, .blog, and others</li>
  <li>$1.99/mo makes it the cheapest option between these hosts I reviewed</li>
</ul>
<p> I would recommend Dreamhost because between these three providers I reviewed, Dreamhost is the most complete package overall; it is the most reliable, safest, easiest, fastest, and the cheapest webhost provider.</p>
