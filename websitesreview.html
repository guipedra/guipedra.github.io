<p> What I like about looking up something on Google is that everyting is very neat and organized. If for example, you look up "Brazil" on that search box, on the left side of the page, it shows the most common/accurate results of what you're looking up, for example the Wikipedia, the Britannica pages for it, and other websites that have the information about the country. There is also a section with "People also ask" with dropdown boxes about the most common questions about the country on Google, I think that is a cool and valuable feature to have. I also how like there is a "box" to the right of the page that compresses the country's main information, such as a quick summary, capital, population, currency, etc. But most importantly, the left and the right sides have enough space to show the information it needs to be shown without overlapping each other, but still being an easy read and understandable. Another feature I like is right below the new and shorter search box on the page, the "News", "Maps","Images", "Videos", and "More" boxes/hyperlinks, that could direct you to those type of informations in a new link. </p>

<p> Overall, I think those result pages are very easy to navigate through, with extremely handful content that always seems to help finding whatever you looked up, just plain colors, but that's not necesarily a bad thing, as simplicity is one of the factors that really helps the navigation on Google. It has good, understandable, and decent sized fonts. All those components and the "functions" I mentioned on the previous paragrapgh, make up for one sensational website.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.espn.com">Espn</a></h2>

<p> After multiple in class analysis on the Espn webpage and its layout, I started to appreciate how everything looked more. From a Web Design point of view, I find in very "aesthatically" pleasing. For starters, the little area on top showing scores of the "Top Events" is a very nice and compact tool, but at the same time, it's very useful. Right below that, there are drop down boxes with different sports/leagues such as soccer, the NFL, NBA, etc., and when you put the cursor over them, it gives options of being directed into that sections' page within the website, whether that is for overall league information and news, or for specific team. Once we get to the head of the page, I really like how it is organized in three different "areas": left, middle, and right. The left side has a menu with quick links, to redirect you to your "favorite" teams (if you are signed up to Espn). In the middle, you got the main news; while I was doing this assignment, it showed me a score of a basketball game happening at the moment, the recap of the Lakers game, and other game scores and more news. And on the right side of the website, there are more headlines and links that will redirect you to different tabs within the website. </p>

<p> From an aesthetic point of view, I think every thing is very easy, accessible, and easy to find. Even though the website is divided in three parts, everything is clear and easy to see. I like the fonts, good size and readable. One detail I noticed about the colors is that the background is white, fonts are mainly black and grey, which is good for contrast, but the button to subscribe for Espn+ content is orange, purposely standing out and trying to catch our attention to look at that button. But I really like how Espn's site functions and works, I've come to realize it is very neat and easy to navigate through it.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">Yale School of Art</a></h2>

<p> I really don't know if this website was hacked or if it is supposed to be a joke or satire about Yale School's of Art, but the website is just not good at all. Starting with the background, it is very random, and it really doesn't add anything to the website. Followed, the school's information is very tiny, not centralized, and around another random feature, the border for the text. The borders seem to be a common, but not a good feature through the website; I find it unnecessary and an extra, added to the fact it's very commonly seen through the website, for the "Header 1", with the name of the school, the on this page information, the "Coming up Events". There are also a lot of boxes through the page; pretty much if it has a longer text other than a title or a header, there is a box around it. And the multitude of colors in those also don't help; there are orange boxes with black text, black boxes with white texts, blue boxes, there is just too much going on. There is a lot of scrolling needed to get to the end of the page, and me personally, I got distracted with the information in the middle, it didn't grab my attention and just made me rush through to get to the bottom. Weird and unnecessary gifs in between, I must add.</p>

<p> But what I disliked the most about this webpage is the fact that the right side of it is just completely empty, with absolutely nothing, while the left and center are crowded. That triggered me. Overall, this webpage is all over the place, poorly organized, overly crowded, with unnecessary/extra features, and unpleasing to search through it. In my opinion, it makes a case for one of the worst websites in website history.</p>
