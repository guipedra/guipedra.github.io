<h1>State Website Review</h1>

<h2>#1: <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov">Nebraska</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>All the "universal website" sections look clean (header, navigation bar, content, and the footer).</li>
  <li>Lots of colors, which catches the viewers' attention as they scroll the page .</li>
  <li>I like the image and those hyperlinks in the circles right when you open the website up, it's dynamic and it looks good.</li>
  <li>Keeps it simple with the content section, with the @Nebraskagov and the calendar informations only.</li>
  <li>Neat coloring, logo, and simple and direct footer.</li>
</ul>
<p> The Nebraska government website is my favorite because it is neat and clean, it looks good, it is simple, well organized, and it is short and straight to the point with the information it wants to show you in the content section, making it  very easy to navigate through it. Also, it loads fast.</p>

<h2>#2: <a href="https://www.illinois.gov">Illinois</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nice, clean logo and list on the header of the page, followed up by the picture and the design with the "Welcome to illinois.gov!" text</li>
  <li>Crowded with lots of information on the content section, but they do a good job organizing and distinguishing each topic with different background colors, and different shapes leading up to the hyperlinks (such as the circles and squares). </li>
  <li>Simple yet efficient footer, with a background color that wasn't seen as we scrolled through the web page before, neat font, and effective, "straight up" information.</li>
</ul>
<p> Illionis' government website is very well organized and colorful, the content section is well laid out, and it has nice features through it, and has a fast load speed.</p>

<h2>#3: <a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>I like how they used the landscape picture subtly on the background.</li>
  <li>Also like how the box of content is centralized through the page.</li>
  <li>Clean and organized header with the logo and the inlined list.</li>
  <li>Really like how they used the picture and divided it in three parts for dropdown lists for Resdients, Businesses and Visitors.</li>
  <li>Too monocolored though.</li>
  <li>Good looking, easy, and organized footer.</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite feature about the Alaska webpage is the picture divided by 3 and used as a dropbox, I thought it is very creative and a very cool and engaging feature.</p>

<h2>#4: <a href="https://delaware.gov">Delaware</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Another good looking footer with the logo on the left handside and the inlined list.</li>
  <li>Lots of scrolling through the content section.</li>
  <li>A lot of information in the content section, I wish they could have kept it shorter and more direct.</li>
  <li>You can tell that you are in a different topic in the content by the background color, which is a nice touch.</li>
  <li>Good looking and organized footer.</li>
</ul>
<p> Although the different contents are designed by the different background colors, I feel like there is too much information and too much going on in general in that section, and it just feels like it is over crowded with information. </p>

<h2>#5: <a href="https://www.myflorida.com">Florida</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>I didn't find it a very engaging webpage.</li>
  <li>Very simple, straight to the point.</li>
  <li>Doesn't include any engaging features such as lists, or dropdown features, or images other than the rocket pitcure, which covers only about a third of the page.</li>
  <li>The only areas in the content section are the search box, the "Contact Us".</li>
  <li>Very mediocre, and by far the simplest footer out of all these state website pages.</li>
</ul>
<p> In my opinion, the Florida government website page is by far the most simple and "boring" webpage out of the previous one we analyzed. It is very monocolored and simple, it seems like no extra effort was put and it almost gives the impression that they are saying "Here, just do the work on your own to find information you want to know".</p>
