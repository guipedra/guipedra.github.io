          <h2>Foundation</h2>
          <p>In 1910, football in Brazil was an elitist sport. The top clubs were formed by people who were part of the upper classes. Among them were Club Athletico Paulistano, São Paulo Athletic Club, and Associação Atlética das Palmeiras. Lower-class society excluded from larger clubs founded their own minnow clubs and only played "floodplain" football.</p>
          <p>Bucking the trend, a group of five workers of the São Paulo Railway, more precisely Joaquim Ambrose and Anthony Pereira (wall painters), Rafael Perrone (shoemaker), Anselmo Correia (driver) and Carlos Silva (general laborer), residents of the neighbourhood of Bom Retiro. It was 31 August 1910 when these workers were watching a match featuring a London-based club touring Brazil, Corinthian F.C.. After the match, while the group returned home, the men spoke of partnerships, business ideas, and general dreams of grandeur. In the mind of each one surfaced a great idea: the foundation of a club, after several exchanges in a lively argument, a common ground led those athletes the same dream. The arguments led to the conclusion that they would meet the next day to make a dream into reality.</p>
          <p>On 1 September 1910 and in anticipation of heavy rains, the group agreed to meet after sundown in public sight. That night at 8:30pm, on Rua José Paulino ("Rua dos Imigrantes"), underneath the glow of an oil lamp the five workers reunited alongside their guest and neighbors from Bom Retiro. That night the club was founded, alongside its board of directors, who elected Miguel Battaglia as the first Club President.</p>

          <h3>Nowadays</h3>
          <p>Nowadays, we play in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A (the top tier of the Brazilian football), as well as in the Campeonato Paulista Série A (the first division of the traditional in-state competition). Listed by Forbes in 2017 as the most valuable football club in the Americas, worth $576.9 million, we are one of the most widely supported teams in the world and the second most in Brazil, with over 30 million fans.</p>
