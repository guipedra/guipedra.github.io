<h1>Hosts Review</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.bluehost.com">Bluehost</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fast and easy design that allows you to get started right away</li>
  <li>Seems to be an easy and simple website creator</li>
  <li>Comes with an "expert help" service in which they can help you 24/7 if you have any questions</li>
  <li>Provides security packages and website protection</li>
  <li>Offers domains such as .com, .net, .org, .online, .site, .tech, and others</li>
  <li>$2.95/mo, cheaper than other web hoster services</li>
</ul>
<p> Bluehost is a great webhost provider, with great features and price, but the reason why I'm not recommending it is because they do not provide guaranteed uptime (website speed), and that is the host I end up choosing does offer it</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.sitebuilder.com">Sitebuilder</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sitebuilder provides a website builder based on questions you answer in an interview right when you join the service</li>
  <li>Simple interface that allows you to edit your page to what youn want while also keeping it professional</li>
  <li>Lets you to check engagement stats and visitor metrics in real-time</li>
  <li>Offers domains such as .com, .net, .org, .info, .eu, .us, etc.</li>
  <li>Varies from $7.18-11.18/mo depending on what plan you choose</li>
</ul>
<p> Although Sitebuilder offers good services and features and it's easy to work with, I wouldn't get their webhosting service, mainly for how much more expensive it is monthly compared to other providers, which total up to a huge difference at the end of the year compared to the other hosts in this review</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Employee-owned: focuses on the unique needs of the users, "committed to helping everyone find success online"</li>
  <li>They have many security features and services</li>
  <li>Provides a strong "anti-spam" policy that assists with privacy</li>
  <li>Guarantees a fast and reliable uptime</li>
  <li>Offers domains such as .club, .io, .online, .com, .shop, .blog, and others</li>
  <li>$1.99/mo makes it the cheapest option between these hosts I reviewed</li>
</ul>
<p> I would recommend Dreamhost because between these three providers I reviewed, Dreamhost is the most complete package overall; it is the most reliable, safest, easiest, fastest, and the cheapest webhost provider.</p>
